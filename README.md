# RabbitMQ

RabbitMQ is an open-source message broker that enables reliable and asynchronous messaging between applications. It is based on the AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol) and facilitates message exchange through queues. RabbitMQ is widely used in microservices, distributed systems, and event-driven architectures for efficient communication.
